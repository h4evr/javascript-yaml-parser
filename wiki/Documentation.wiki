In the 'lib' folder, you can find the JSDoc toolkit.
This toolkit is used to generate the documentation for the project.
The documentation is in the folder 'doc'. 
Use a web browser to visualize 'index.html', the base file of the documentation.
To generate the documentation again, open a terminal and navigate to the folder
where the file 'Makefile' is. Then, run the command 'make'. This will generate
the documentation.
